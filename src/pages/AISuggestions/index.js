          While our team was examining ways to improve work experience quality on resumes, a new technology emerged, generative AI. After spending time learning about and using the latest LLMs, it became clear that this new technology could enable us to do something that was previously impossible: provide instant resume help, at scale, to all of Indeed‚Äôs job seekers.

        <p>
          To establish a shared understanding of what makes a strong work experience section, I consulted with Indeed‚Äôs top resume-writing coach to gather her high-level recommendations and insights into what employers prioritize. I distilled these findings into five key guidelines for our suggestions, including detailed explanations and examples of strong resume content.

                Relevant and specific
              </li>

          These guidelines moved the project forward in several ways. I could incorporate realistic content for various professions into my designs, helping the team visualize the end result and ensuring the designs could handle longer text strings. The guidelines also clarified functionality requirements and guided decision-making with product owners. For example, we concluded that our suggestions needed to include variables to make them easy to customize.

          After finalizing the guidelines, I used them to develop a prompt for generating suggestions and later to assess the quality of the output. I created a prompt for GPT 3.5, specifying the desired length, formatting, and tone. Once the generated bullet points for several job titles looked good, I teamed up with an engineer to refine and test the prompt. We iterated on my initial draft to reduce repetition, improve formatting, and prevent nonsensical responses.

        <p>
          After proving that we could create a prompt that generates results which follow our content guidelines, I created feature requirements and worked with a PM to get the feature on the engineering team‚Äôs roadmap. Requirements included:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>

          <li>
            <strong>
              User-selected suggestions are added inline to job descriptions

              Suggestions are tied to job titles in Indeed‚Äôs taxonomy
            </strong>
            <br />
            After discussions with engineering, we chose to limit suggestions to job titles within Indeed‚Äôs 11,000-title taxonomy to reduce API costs and speed up response times. This approach also mitigated LLM risks by preventing inappropriate inputs.
          </li>
          <li>

              Users can select one or more suggestions

            <br />
            5-7 bullet points are recommended for most roles.

          <li>
            <strong>

          Participants who viewed bullet points on a separate screen from the rich-text editor didn‚Äôt realize they could edit the suggestions.

        <p>
          I revisited the design to incorporate findings from the usability test. Displaying suggestions on a dedicated screen provided a focused experience. However, when suggestions were shown separately, users were less likely to edit and customize the content. To address this, I tried a new approach by placing suggestions in a modal that could be accessed from the main form, aiming to maintain a focused experience while clearly linking suggestions to the editor.
        </p>

        <p>
          By this stage, we had also finalized the first version of the prompt, so we wanted to validate both the AI-generated content as well as the updated design. To allow users to interact with real suggestions for their job titles, our UX researcher recommended using a coded prototype for the next round of usability testing. So I collaborated with a front-end developer to build a prototype that could access our database of suggestions.

          Solving usability issues
        </h2>

        <p>
          The main usability issue was with the empty state. We had pre-populated the job title to save time for users by displaying relevant suggestions immediately. However, this approach only worked if the job title was in our database. Many users encountered an empty state because their job titles did not exactly match our taxonomy, and they struggled to recover without help from our researcher.
        </p>

        <p>
          I met with the researcher and PM to discuss these issues. We agreed that better, more explanatory copy was needed, so I reworked the headers and label. I also collaborated with our engineer to only pre-fill the job title when suggestions were available. This way, users would see related job titles in an autocomplete once they started interacting with this field.

        <p>With the validation from usability testing, we felt ready to finalize and launch the feature. I worked closely with our front-end engineers to ensure that all details transferred properly to the live product. I double-checked the details on various device sizes, paying attention to edge cases, loading animations, and hover states. Once we were satisfied, we started to roll out the feature in production. Here‚Äôs the final UX: </p>

          <strong>90%</strong> of job seekers who see the suggestions select at least one to add to their resume.

          For the longer term, we implemented tracking to see whether applicants using this feature were more likely to receive responses from employers.
